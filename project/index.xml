      <description>Environmental DNA (eDNA) meta-barcoding offers unprecidented insights into the ecology of biological communities, enabling comprehensive assessments of biodiversity from only trace amounts of genetic material. Yet several analytical challenges remain, particularly when incorporating robust statistical inference in the assignment of taxonomic identities. False discovery rates at low taxonomic ranks are often well above those generally considered acceptable in biology, leading to questionable conclusions being reported in the literature. In this project, we focus on developing new supervised machine-learning algorithms that incorporate full probabilistic models to identify the taxonomic sources of environmental DNA amplicon sequences.</description>

      <description>The symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae is essential for the development and survival of coral reefs. Yet this fragile association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. A coralâ€™s ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite population genetic structure of Symbiodiniaceae is poorly understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted from thousands to millions of cells.</description>
