      <description>Global climate change is having devastating effects on the world’s coral reefs, with declines predicted to escalate sharply in the near future. Severe socio-economic impacts accompany reef degradation, including the loss of food security, coastal stability and tourism income for many of the world’s most vulnerable people. The newly-independent Indo-Pacific nation of Timor-Leste hosts one of the most diverse coral assemblage on Earth, with upwards of 500 coral species potentially inhabiting its reefs.</description>

      <description>The symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae is essential for the development and survival of coral reefs. Yet this fragile association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. A coral’s ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite population genetic structure of Symbiodiniaceae is poorly understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted from thousands to millions of cells.</description>
